# S.Cook PetClinic Project FrontEnd
Frontend React SPA for a sample PetClinic project written mostly from scratch with the help of a few initialization utilities

## Requirements
This has been tested with NodeJs v10.10.0 and npm v6.4.1

## Run Project
(I have not written any tests for this project, but if I had this is how you could run them)
```console
$ npm start
```

## Explanation of Project
This project was initialized using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) (I'm not sure which version I am using).  It uses ReactJs, Redux, MaterialUi (for UI components), and a fairly shallow component tree.
